    "\n",
    "This notebook completed the following preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the fixed games dataset (games_fixed.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**: \n",
    "   - Removed irrelevant features (URLs, images, identifiers)\n",
    "   - Removed \"cheat\" features (post-launch metrics like Peak CCU, reviews, playtime)\n",
    "   - Kept \"About the game\" text field untouched for future NLP processing\n",
    "   - Parsed \"Release date\" into numeric features: Release_Year, Release_Month, Release_Day\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Target Variable Transformation**:\n",
    "   - Removed rows with \"0 - 0\" estimated owners (noisy data)\n",
    "   - Created categorical target variable `popularity_class` with 3 levels: Low, Medium, High\n",
    "   - Removed original `Estimated owners` column\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Cleaning**:\n",
    "   - Handled missing values using median imputation for numeric features\n",
    "   - Handled missing values using mode imputation for categorical features\n",
    "   - Dropped rows with remaining missing values (e.g., missing target)\n",
    "   - Removed duplicate records\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Outlier Detection and Handling**:\n",
    "   - Detected outliers using IQR method\n",
    "   - Capped outliers to preserve data (Winsorization)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Explicitly identified multi-value categorical features (Genres, Tags, Categories, Supported languages, Full audio languages)\n",
    "   - Created binary features for top 15 values in each multi-value feature\n",
    "   - Dropped original multi-value columns after encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
    "   - Applied StandardScaler only to continuous numeric features (price, DLC count, etc.)\n",
    "   - **Excluded from scaling:**\n",
    "     - Date features (Release_Year, Release_Month, Release_Day) - preserve temporal meaning\n",
    "     - Binary features (Genres_*, Tags_*, Categories_*, Supported languages_*, Full audio languages_*) - keep as 0/1 for interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Saved preprocessed dataset to `data/processed/games_preprocessed.csv`\n",
    "   - \"About the game\" text field remains untouched and ready for NLP analysis"
